# State Management with Redux

If we are going to create a bigger application in Angular then it will be better to use a state management architecture that can manage the state of our application. This state management technique will definitely increase the performance of our application. 
In this application we learn about the "Redux" that is state management technique to manage the state of application.Redux is an open-source JavaScript library designed for managing application state. It is primarily used together with React or angular js for building user interfaces

## BugTodoApp
In this project we will create a bug management system, we add the functionality to add the new bugs, update the current status of the bug and also show the bug list and diffrent status counts of the bugs. We will use the Redux to manage the state of our application.
